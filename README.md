## Development Process:

#### Initial Setup:

Downloaded and organized all icons and images required for the webpage.

#### Design Considerations:

Analyzed the color schemes used throughout the website, paying particular attention to the colors emphasizing keywords for improved visual hierarchy.

#### Font Selection:

Chose and integrated the 'Lexend' font-family from Google Fonts to enhance readability and user experience.

#### Lazy Loading Optimization:

Developed a Lazy Image Loader component to improve page load times and optimize performance by loading images only when they enter the viewport.

#### Asset Organization:

Grouped all images and icons into a dedicated 'assets' folder for easy navigation and management.

#### Template Structure:

Created a 'Base' template to centralize shared components (e.g., Header, Footer) for consistency across all pages.

#### Homepage Componentization:

Divided the homepage into modular components to promote reusability and maintainability.

#### Animation Integration:

Implemented Framer Motion for smooth, engaging animations throughout the website to enhance interactivity.

### Challenges Faced:

#### 'Discover' Section Overflow:

Encountered a challenge ensuring that the last image in the 'Discover' section remains within the viewport without overflowing. Investigated various techniques to resolve this issue, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
